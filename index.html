                                hardly exists anymore! If anything, females make up more of the workforce than men.
                                This debate needs to be stopped.

                                The visualization depicts weekly wage for male and female workers in different
                                categories of occupations
                                clearly illustrating the existence of a gender pay gap. It shows how females earn
                                significantly
                                less than their male counterparts in those job categories where they seem to make up the
                                majority
                                of workers(as seen on the left chart). The stark
                                contrast in wages can be clearly seen, making it difficult to deny the
                                existence of the gender pay gap!

                                One controversial topic that has been the subject of debate for decades is the existence
                                and extent of the gender pay gap. While some argue that it is a thing of the past or is
                                overstated, others maintain that it is a persistent and systemic problem that
                                contributes to gender inequality in the workforce. The topic is complex and
                                multifaceted, involving factors such as occupational segregation, discrimination, and
                                societal expectations. Despite ongoing efforts to address the issue, there is still a
                                significant gap between male and female earnings in many industries and professions,
                                leading to ongoing controversy and debate in the United States.
                                This dataset from the Bureau of Labor Statistics provides a
                                comprehensive look at the median weekly incomes of 535 different occupations broken down
                                by gender. This data can be used to analyze the existence and magnitude of the gender
                                pay gap in different industries. The dataset can be found <a

                            The left chart is persuasive because it

                            glance. The use of color coding to distinguish between male and female workers is
                            effective in emphasizing the higher number of female workers in most of the categories,
                            which challenges the notion that men dominate certain industries.
